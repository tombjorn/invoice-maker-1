# invoice-maker-1

! WIP !

- simple invoice maker, saves as pdf
- no backend, but would like to implement a simple database to store invoices and remember latest index number, this is all just js practise at the end of the day.
- layout, both html and in the resulting pdf need to be worked on, but thats the boring stuff.

TODO:

- get default pixel size of pdf in portrait
- implement this width in css so it formats properly
